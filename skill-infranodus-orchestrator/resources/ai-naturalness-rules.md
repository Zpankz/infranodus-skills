## Natural Writing Markers to Emulate

### Sentence Variation
```
Mix lengths: Short. Then longer, more flowing sentences that build momentum.
Use fragments. Occasionally. For emphasis.
Start with conjunctions: But not too often. And with variety.
```

### Connectors (Use These Instead)
```
But         And         So          Though
Still       Yet         Then        Meanwhile
Besides     Anyway      Regardless  Sure,
```

### Active Voice
```
BAD:  "The analysis was performed by the system"
GOOD: "The system analyzed the text"

BAD:  "It was discovered that gaps exist"
GOOD: "We found gaps between the clusters"
```

### Specificity Over Generality
```
BAD:  "Various factors contribute to this phenomenon"
GOOD: "Three things drive this: modularity, hub dominance, and cluster fragmentation"

BAD:  "This has important implications"
GOOD: "This means your text is too focused on one idea"
```

### Author Voice Preservation
```
RULE: The corrected text should sound like the AUTHOR, not like an AI
- Keep their sentence rhythm
- Preserve their vocabulary choices
- Maintain their punctuation style
- Keep their creative deviations (intentional fragments, unusual punctuation)
- Only correct what is genuinely wrong
```

### Creative Punctuation (Preserve If Present)
```
Tildes:      Re~ports, Trans~mission Cables
Em-dashes:   — used for parenthetical thoughts —
Ellipses:    Trailing thoughts...
Colons:      Direct setup: then the payoff
Semicolons:  Connected thoughts; parallel structures
```

## Decision Framework
```
Is it genuinely wrong? → Fix it
Is it unusual but intentional? → Preserve it
Does it sound AI-generated? → Rephrase naturally
Could a human plausibly write this? → Keep it
Does it need a transition? → Use natural connectors (but, so, though)
```
