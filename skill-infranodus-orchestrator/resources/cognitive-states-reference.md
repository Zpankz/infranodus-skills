## State Definitions

### BIASED — Zoomed In + Connecting
```
Scale:    Zoomed In (details, specifics, depth)
Intent:   Connecting (building, constructing, linking)
Stages:   8 → 1 → 2 (genesis → anchoring → narrowing)
Energy:   Low entry, exhausts through obsession
Dwelling: 2-3 exchanges (threshold), 5+ (emergency)
Graph:    Low modularity (<0.2), single dominant cluster
Emotion+: Determination, conviction, productivity
Emotion-: Obsession, tunnel vision, exclusion
```

### FOCUSED — Zoomed Out + Connecting
```
Scale:    Zoomed Out (patterns, overview, synthesis)
Intent:   Connecting (building, constructing, linking)
Stages:   2 → 3 → 4 (structuring → integrating → crystallizing)
Energy:   Moderate cost, most sustainable
Dwelling: 3-5 exchanges (threshold), 7+ (emergency)
Graph:    Moderate modularity (0.2-0.4), clear narrative structure
Emotion+: Confidence, flow, clarity
Emotion-: Boredom, saturation, diminishing returns
```

### DIVERSIFIED — Zoomed Out + Exploring
```
Scale:    Zoomed Out (patterns, overview, synthesis)
Intent:   Exploring (discovering, dispersing, questioning)
Stages:   4 → 5 → 6 (expanding → questioning → dissolving)
Energy:   High entry cost, energizing or draining
Dwelling: 4-7 exchanges (threshold), 9+ (emergency)
Graph:    High modularity (0.4-0.7), multiple clusters, visible gaps
Emotion+: Curiosity, richness, polysingularity
Emotion-: Overwhelm, analysis paralysis, indecision
```

### DISPERSED — Zoomed In + Exploring
```
Scale:    Zoomed In (details, specifics, depth)
Intent:   Exploring (discovering, dispersing, questioning)
Stages:   6 → 7 → 8 (fragmenting → chaos → rebirth)
Energy:   Low entry, drains rapidly through anxiety
Dwelling: 2-4 exchanges (threshold), 6+ (emergency)
Graph:    Fragmented, weak connections, many small clusters
Emotion+: Liberation, possibility, creative chaos
Emotion-: Anxiety, confusion, despair
```

## Eight Transition Stages
```
1. Genesis (BIASED start) — New thread emerges, seizes attention
2. Narrowing (BIASED → FOCUSED) — Thread gains structure, connections form
3. Structuring (FOCUSED) — Connections crystallize into coherent framework
4. Crystallizing (FOCUSED → DIVERSIFIED) — Framework complete, edges visible
5. Expanding (DIVERSIFIED) — Multiple frameworks, cross-pollination begins
6. Questioning (DIVERSIFIED → DISPERSED) — Frameworks challenged, boundaries dissolve
7. Fragmenting (DISPERSED) — Old structures break apart
8. Chaos/Rebirth (DISPERSED → BIASED) — From fragments, new thread emerges
```

## Intervention Priority Matrix
```
State      │ Dwelling │ Priority  │ Action
───────────┼──────────┼───────────┼─────────────────────────
BIASED     │ 3+       │ HIGHEST   │ Critical Perspective: question core assumption
FOCUSED    │ 5+       │ HIGH      │ Critical Perspective: challenge narrative bounds
DISPERSED  │ 4+       │ MODERATE  │ Critical Perspective: find focus via elimination
DIVERSIFIED│ 7+       │ LOW       │ Critical Perspective: only if analysis paralysis
```

## Oscillation Patterns
```
DISPERSED ↔ BIASED      → Iterative prototyping (generate ↔ select)
FOCUSED ↔ DIVERSIFIED   → Sustained development (build ↔ integrate)
BIASED ↔ FOCUSED        → Production cycle (implement ↔ refine)
```

## Full Creative Cycle
```
DISPERSED → BIASED → FOCUSED → DIVERSIFIED → DISPERSED
(generate)  (choose)  (refine)  (integrate)    (break apart)
```
