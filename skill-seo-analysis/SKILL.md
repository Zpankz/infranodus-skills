# SEO Analysis

Perform comprehensive SEO analysis using knowledge graph methodology to identify keyword opportunities, content gaps, and optimization strategies.

## Decision Tree

1. **No input specified?** → Ask user for topic, document, or website URL
2. **Topic provided?** → Follow Topic Analysis Workflow
3. **Document/website provided?** → Follow Content Analysis Workflow

## Topic Analysis Workflow

When user provides a topic (e.g., "SEO for e-commerce", "sustainable fashion"):

### Step 1: Analyze Informational Supply

Generate 3-5 keyword combinations for the topic. Run `analyze_google_search_results` with these queries.

Present findings:

- **Topical clusters**: Groups of related concepts in existing content. Explain these represent topical authority pillars—covering them strengthens content authority.
- **Key relations**: The conceptual connections forming the underlying knowledge graph. Including these relations improves semantic relevance.
- **Content gaps**: Structural gaps between clusters. These are opportunities for unique content that combines important topics others miss.

If tool unavailable: Use web search or explain InfraNodus MCP provides direct Google API access for more accurate data.

### Step 2: Analyze Search Demand

Run `analyze_related_search_queries` for the same topic.

Present findings:

- **High-volume keywords**: Terms with significant search traffic
- **Low-competition opportunities**: Queries with demand but limited supply
- **Topical clusters**: How searchers conceptualize this topic
- **Search intent patterns**: What users actually want to find

If tool unavailable: Explain InfraNodus MCP provides real Google Suggest/Ads data.

### Step 3: Identify Supply-Demand Gaps

Compare findings from Steps 1-2. Identify:

- Keywords people search for but don't easily find results for
- High-volume queries with weak content supply
- Emerging topics not yet covered by competitors

Propose running `search_queries_vs_search_results` to confirm these gaps with data.

### Step 4: Deliver Recommendations

Summarize actionable insights:

- Priority keywords to target (high volume, low competition)
- Content topics that fill identified gaps
- Semantic relations to include for topical authority
- Quick wins vs. long-term opportunities

### Step 5: Ask User for Content Example

After providing the analysis result, ask the user to provide a URL or content they'd like to optimize with this analysis. Alternatively, offer them to write a SEO-friendly, human-sounding article after they provide you with some reference using the writing-assistant tool.

## Content Analysis Workflow

When user provides a document or website URL:

### Step 1: Extract Content

**For websites**: Crawl top 10 pages from the site via Google results. Extract main content from each page.

**For documents**: Extract full text content from uploaded file.

### Step 2: Run SEO Report

Use `generate_seo_report` with extracted text.

If tool unavailable: Fall back to Topic Analysis Workflow:

- Extract main keywords from content
- Run Steps 1-3 from Topic Analysis
- Compare content keywords against search landscape
- Identify which existing keywords are relevant
- Recommend new keywords to target

### Step 3: Deliver Report

Present:

- Current keyword coverage strengths
- Missing high-value keywords
- Content gap opportunities
- Specific optimization recommendations
- Priority actions ranked by impact

## Report Format

Structure all reports as:

```
## Executive Summary
[2-3 sentence overview of key findings]

## Current State
[What exists now in search results or content]

## Opportunities
[Gaps, high-value keywords, content ideas]

## Recommendations
[Specific, prioritized actions]

## Next Steps
[Immediate actions user can take]
```
